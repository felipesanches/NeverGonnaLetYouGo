\textbf{Never Gonna Let You Go (Barry Mann / Cynthia Weil)}

\hrule

\emph{Intro:}

[F#m7] ~ [Bm7] ~ [E] ~ [E/G#] ~ [A] ~ [A/C#] ~ [Dadd9] ~ [Eadd9] ~ [F#add9]

\hrule

\emph{Verse:}

[Gm7]I was as [Cm7]wrong as I could [F]be

To let you [Bb/D]get away from [Eb]me

I'll [Bb/D]regret that move

For as [Ab7+]long as I'm livin' [Eb/F] ~ [F/G] ~



[Em7]But now that I've [Am7]come to see the [D]light

All [D/C]I wanna [G/B]do is make things [C]right

So just [G/B]say the word

And [C/D]tell me that I'm [D/C]forgiven

\hrule

\emph{Pre-Chorus:}

[Bbsus2]You and me

We're [Fsus2/A]gonna be better [Gm7]than we [C/E]were [C/F]before [F] ~

[Csus2]I loved you then but now [G/B]I intend

To [F#m7]open up and [B]love you even more [B/E] ~ [E] ~ [B/E] ~ [E] ~

This [Ebm7b5]time you can be [Ab7b9]sure

\pagebreak
\hrule

\emph{Chorus:}

[Fm7]I'm never gonna let you [Bbm7]go

I'm gonna [Eb]hold you in my [Eb/Db]arms [Cm7(b6)]forever

Gonna [Db]try and make up for all the [G7]times

I hurt you [C]so

[Bb/C]Go-o-o[C/D]nna-a-a [F#m7]hold your body close to [Bm7]mine

From this [E]day on we're [E/D]gonna be [C#m7(b6)]together

Oh I [Dadd9]swear this time

I'm [Eadd9]never gonna let you [F#add9]go

\hrule

\emph{Verse 2:}

[Gm7]Looking back [Cm7]now It seems so [F]clear

I had it [Bb/D]all when you were [Eb]here

Oh you [Bb/D]gave it all

And I [Eb/Ab]took it for granted [Eb/F] ~ [F/G] ~



[Em7]But if there's some [Am7]feeling left in [D]you

Some [D/C]flickers of [G/B]love

That still shines [C]through

Let's [G/B]talk it out

Let's [C/D]talk about second [D/C]chances

\pagebreak
\hrule

\emph{Pre-Chorus:}

[Bbsus2]Wait and see

It's [Fsus2/A]gonna be sweeter [Gm7]than it [C/E]was [C/F]before [F] ~

[Csus2]I gave some then but now [G/B]I intend

[F#m7]To dedicate [B]myself to giving more [B/E] ~ [E] ~ [B/E] ~ [E] ~ 

[Ebm7b5]This time you can be [Ab7b9]sure


\hrule

\emph{Chorus:}

[Fm7]I'm never gonna let you [Bbm7]go

I'm gonna [Eb]hold you in my [Eb/Db]arms [Cm7(b6)]forever

Gonna [Db]try and make up for all the [G7]times

I hurt you [C]so

[Bb/C]Go-o-o[C/D]nna-a-a [F#m7]hold your body close to [Bm7]mine

From this [E]day on we're [E/D]gonna be [C#m7(b6)]together

Oh I [Dadd9]swear this time

I'm [Eadd9]never gonna let you [F#add9]go

\pagebreak
\hrule

\emph{Solo:}

[Ebm7] ~ [Ebm/Db] ~ [Ab/C] ~ [C#/B]

[Bbm7] ~ [B/A]

[G#m7] ~ [F#/A#]

[B] ~ ~ [Fm7b5] ~ [Bb7b9]

[Ebmaj7]Oh... So if [Dm7b5]you'll just say

[G7b9]You want me too...


I'm [Em7]never gonna let you [Am7]go

I'm gonna [D]hold you in my [D/C]arms [Bm7(b6)]forever

Gonna [C]try and make up for all the [F#7]times

I hurt you [B]so

[A/B]Go-o-o[B/C#]nna-a-a [Fm7]hold your body close to [Bbm7]mine

From this [Eb]day on we're [Eb/Db]gonna be [Ab/C]together

Oh I [Db]swear this time

I'm [Eb]never gonna let you [F]go [Eb/F] ~ [F/G] ~


\hrule

\emph{Out chorus (Michael Landay Guitar Solo):}

[Bbm7]I'm never gonna let you [Ebm7]go

I'm gonna [Ab]hold you in my [Ab/Gb]arms [Db/F]forever

Gonna [F#7]try and make up for all the [C]times

I hurt you [F]so ~ [Eb/F] ~ [F/G] ~

Gonna [Bbm7]hold your body close to [Ebm7]mine

From this [Ab]day on we're [Ab/Gb]gonna be [Db/F]together

Oh I [Gb]swear this time

So [Ab]if you'll just say you want me [Bb]too...
