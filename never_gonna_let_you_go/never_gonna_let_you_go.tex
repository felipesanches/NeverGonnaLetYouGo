\textbf{Never Gonna Let You Go (Barry Mann / Cynthia Weil)}

\hrule

\emph{Intro:}

[F#m7] ~ [Bm7] ~ [E] ~ [E/G#] ~ [A] ~ [A/C#] ~ [Dadd9] ~ [Eadd9] ~ [F#add9]

\hrule

\emph{Verse:}

[Gm7]I was as [Cm7]wrong as I could [F]be

To let you [Bb/D]get away from [Eb]me

I'll [Bb/D]regret that move

For as [Ab7+]long as I'm livin' [Eb/F] ~ [F/G] ~

\hrule

[Em7]But now that I've [Am7]come to see the [D]light

All [D/C]I wanna [G/B]do is make things [C]right

So just [G/B]say the word

And [C/D]tell me that I'm [D/C]forgiven

\hrule

\emph{Pre-Chorus:}

[Bbsus2]You and me

We're [Fsus2/A]gonna be better [Gm7]than we [C/E]were [C/F]before [F] ~

[Csus2]I loved you then but now [G/B]I intend

To [F#m7]open up and [B]love you even more [B/E] ~ [E] ~ [B/E] ~ [E] ~

This [Ebm7b5]time you can be [Ab7b9]sure

\hrule

\emph{Chorus:}

I'm never gonna let you go

I'm gonna hold you in  my arms forever

Gonna try and make up for all the times

I hurt you so

Go-o-onna-a-a hold your body close to mine

From this day on we're gonna be together

Oh I swear this time

I'm never gonna let you go
Looking back now  It seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh you gave it all
And I took it for granted
But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flickers of love
That still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances
Wait and see
It's gonna be sweeter than it was   before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to giving more

This time you can be sure

Solo:
[D#7] ~[D#7/C#] ~[Cm7/5-] ~[C#/B] ~[A#m7] ~[A7/5-]
[G#m7] ~[A#m7] ~[B7+] ~[Fm7/5-] ~[A#7] ~[D#9/7+] ~[D#7+] 
[D#9/7+] ~[D#7+]

Oh... So if you'll just say
You want me too...
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Go-o-onna-a-a hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh I swear this time
So if you'll just say you want me too...
